Just acknowledging that stress is there is a good first step.\n\nTell me a little more about what's making you feel so stressed. Is it the feeling of being unprepared, the pressure to do well, or something else entirely? Sometimes just talking it through can help ease the tension a bit.\n\nIn the meantime, remember to breathe. Taking a few slow, deep breaths can actually calm your nervous system. Also, even though you're stressed about studying, try to incorporate some short breaks. Get up, stretch, listen to a favorite song, or do something that helps you relax for even just five or ten minutes. It can actually help you focus better when you return to studying.\n\nWe'll figure this out together. Just let me know what's on your mind."
