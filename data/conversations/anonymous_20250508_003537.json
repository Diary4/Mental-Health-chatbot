It sounds incredibly tiring to want to be free from that.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what anxiety is. It's essentially your body's natural response to stress. It's a feeling of fear, worry, or unease, and it can manifest in different ways for different people. Sometimes it's a physical feeling, like a racing heart or butterflies in your stomach. Other times, it's more mental, like racing thoughts or a sense of dread. When anxiety becomes excessive, persistent, and interferes with your daily life, it can become a disorder.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to be free of thinking. That's a very common feeling when anxiety is overwhelming. It's like your mind is stuck in a loop, and you just want it to stop.\n\nIt's important to know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are things you can do to manage your anxiety and find some relief. It's probably not realistic to completely eliminate thinking, but we can definitely work on quieting those anxious thoughts and finding some peace.\n\nWould you like to talk more about what your anxiety feels like specifically? Knowing more about your experiences might help us explore some coping strategies. Maybe we can discuss some things that have helped you in the past, or brainstorm new approaches to manage those racing thoughts. We could also talk about simple relaxation techniques like deep breathing or grounding exercises that might offer some immediate relief.\n\nRemember, I'm here to listen and support you. We can take things at your own pace. What feels right for you to talk about right now?"
