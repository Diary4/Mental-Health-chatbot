      "content": "Okay, I understand. You're asking about self-esteem. \n\nSimply put, self-esteem is how you feel about yourself overall. It's your opinion of yourself and your abilities. It's about believing that you are valuable and worthy of respect. It's not necessarily about thinking you're perfect or better than others, but rather accepting yourself \u2013 flaws and all \u2013 and appreciating your own worth.\n\nDoes that definition resonate with you? Are you exploring your own self-esteem at the moment? If you'd like to talk more about it, or perhaps explore some things that can impact self-esteem, I'm here to listen."
