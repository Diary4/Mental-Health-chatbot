However, I can say that I've been actively processing and learning from a lot of information lately. I'm continuously working to improve my ability to understand and respond to your needs. Thank you for asking! It's helpful for me to understand how you perceive my role and function.\n\nAnd, since you asked, how have *you* been feeling lately? I'm here to listen if you'd like to share."

If you feel comfortable sharing a little more about what's happening, I'm here to listen. Even if you don't want to share details, just knowing that someone is listening can sometimes make a difference.\n\nAnd to answer your question directly, yes, I do have ways to access information and support, although as an AI, I don't experience trust in the same way a human does. My purpose is to be a helpful resource for you."
