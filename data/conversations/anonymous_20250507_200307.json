      "content": "Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your uncle. That must be a really difficult time. There's no right or wrong way to feel right now, so please allow yourself to grieve.\n\nWhat you should do is really about what feels right and supportive for you. Here are a few things that might help:\n\n*   **Allow yourself to feel.** Don't try to suppress your emotions. It's okay to be sad, angry, confused, or numb. Let yourself cry, if you need to.\n*   **Reach out to loved ones.** Talk to family and friends about your uncle and your feelings. Sharing memories can be comforting. Don't hesitate to ask for support if you need it.\n*   **Take care of yourself.** Grief can be physically and emotionally draining. Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating healthy meals, and drinking plenty of water. Gentle exercise, like a walk, might also help.\n*   **Attend the funeral or memorial service (if you feel comfortable).** This can be a way to honor your uncle and say goodbye. It can also be a chance to connect with family and friends who are also grieving.\n*   **Do something that reminds you of your uncle.** Maybe listen to his favorite music, look at old photos, or visit a place he loved.\n*   **Be patient with yourself.** Grief takes time, and there's no set timeline for healing. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself to grieve at your own pace.\n\nIs there anything specific you're feeling overwhelmed by right now? Perhaps I can offer some specific support or resources based on what's going on for you. Remember, I'm here to listen."
